       <li>Body element represents the visual content shown to the user</li>
       <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets</li>
       <li>The top declaration tells the browser what documenmt type it should expect ie. !DOCTYPE html to indicate HTML</li>
       <li>Opening tag represents the root of our document and the attribute inside tells the browser the language for the webpage</li>
       <li>Title defines the title for the webpage</li>
       <li>Style defines the CSS styles associated with the webpage</li>

       <li>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
       <li>Content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. Closing tags begin with a forward slash</li>
       <li>H1-h6 represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>

     <ul>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>touch style.css adds CSS to your file</li>
       <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
       <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
       <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
       <li>External CSS style sheet is used when you link the file using a link element in the HTML head element</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
       <li>* symbol is used to apply a rule to ALL the elements visible on a page</li>
       <li></li>

       <li>git add -A commits all files in the working branch</li>
       <li>git commit -m "your note" associates a message with your commit</li>
       <li>git pull origin main pulls in the base branch, always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.</li>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
       <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
       <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
       <li>touch script.js command is used to add JavaScript to your file</li>
       <li>each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
       <li>console.log method is used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
       <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
       <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
       <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition is not true or has a value that is not truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
       <li>else if is used to have more than one condition</li>
       <li>array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
       <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
       <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
       <li>A for loops is composed of a starting point for our loop, a condition, and a final statement that allows the array to iterate over each item</li>
       <li>x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1</li>
       <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. Done by /* /*</li>
       <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
       <li>you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
       <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses</li>
